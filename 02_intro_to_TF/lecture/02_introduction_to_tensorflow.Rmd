## Historic Highlights of Artificial Neural Networks?

- 1940's: Neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts wrote a paper on how neurons might work
- 1975: First multilayered back propagated network developed by Paul Werbos
- 2015: François Chollet, a Google engineer, releases [Keras](https://keras.io/), a high level Deep Learning API
- 2015: Google releases [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as open source software
- 2017: Google's TensorFlow team decides to support Keras in TensorFlow's core library
- 2018: On day 2 at rstudio::conf 2018 in San Diego, RStudio CEO J.J. Allaire gives his keynote talk on ["Machine Learning with R and TensorFlow"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atiYXm7JZv0), officially announcing, that henceforth Keras and TensorFlow will by fully available in R 

## Keras and TensorFlow - What you need to know

- TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computations written in `C++` (I.e. not confined to ANNs)
- Originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research
- The core TensorFlow API is written in `Python`
- Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in `Python` running on top of TensorFlow (or CNTK or Theano)
- Keras was developed by by François Chollet with a focus on enabling fast experimentation _"Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research"_
- The Keras R-package is written in `R` by François Chollet and JJ Allaire
- The Keras interface is a really nice high level vocabulary for doing deep learning that fits really well with the way R-users work and think
- JJ Allaire has stated that _"I have my heart in getting Keras and TensorFlow to work really really well in Deep Learning in R and hook into the RStudio IDE"_
- The Keras `R` API calls the Keras `Python` API, which calls the core `Python` TensorFlow API which calls the TensorFlow `C++` library
- Granted, a bit complicated, but my experience so far is, that it works

    - [tfestimators](https://github.com/rstudio/tfestimators) - Implementations of common model types such as regressors and classifiers
    - [tensorflow](https://github.com/rstudio/tensorflow) - Low-level interface the TensorFlow computational graph
    - [tfdatasets](https://github.com/rstudio/tfdatasets) - Scalable input pipelines for TensorFlow models
- Supporting tools
    - [tfruns](https://github.com/rstudio/tfruns) - Track, visualise and manage TensorFlow training runs and experiments
    - [tfdeploy](https://github.com/rstudio/tfdeploy) - Tools designed to make exporting and serving TensorFlow models straightforward
    - [cloudml](https://github.com/rstudio/cloudml) - R interface to Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine
